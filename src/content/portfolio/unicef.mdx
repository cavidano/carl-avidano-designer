<IntroBlock>

Used in over 80 countries, UNICEF's Funding Marketplace improves the quality of donor income.

My work with UNICEF began as an independent contractor. This assignment continued through my company, [Avidano Digital](/portfolio/avidano-digital).

### Designing a Prescriptive CMS

With direction from a tech lead and UNICEF staff, I was the sole UX designer of The Funding Marketplace. This custom-designed CMS regulates donor-facing financial data, budget reports, and Human Interest Materials.

The Funding Marketplace empowered UNICEF Country Offices to share critical information to donors. The desktop application made this information available via *Donor Toolkits*.

The application interface offered several ways to search and filter available Donor Toolkits.

Toolkits present a wealth of complex funding information without overwhelming the interface.

### Toolkit dashboard

The dashboard area allows UNICEF staff to manage Donor Toolkit content. Here, too, Country Offices and donors can communicate with one another.
