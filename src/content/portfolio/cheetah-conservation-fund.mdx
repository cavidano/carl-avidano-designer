<IntroBlock>

Headquartered in Namibia, Africa, Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) is an international conservation organization dedicated to saving the cheetah in the wild.

Through Avidano Digital, I led the design and development of a new mobile-friendly website experience for visitors across the world.

CCF desired a new logo to replace their outdated, image-based logo, which was not scalable and did not work as a single color. Because their existing logo was so recognizable, a complete redesign was not an option. Instead, I drew a simple, vector version of the cheetah and adjusted the type to make the logo feel contemporary.
