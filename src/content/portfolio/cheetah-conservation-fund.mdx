<IntroBlock>

Headquartered in Namibia, Africa, Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) is an international conservation organization dedicated to saving the cheetah in the wild.

Through Avidano Digital, I led the design and development of a new mobile-friendly website experience for visitors across the world.

CCF desired a new logo to replace their outdated, image-based logo, which was not scalable and did not work as a single color. Because their existing logo was so recognizable, a complete redesign was not an option. Instead, I drew a simple, vector version of the cheetah and adjusted the type to make the logo feel contemporary.

Working closely with CCF staff, I restructured the content across cheetah.org to make information easy to find with intuitive navigation in the header and footer. The homepage presents a hierarchy of featured content, up-to-date news, and videos. The information pages are presented in a journalistic, readable style.

Content across cheetah.org is designed for optimal readability on devices and desktops.

The website was built with WordPress and Advanced Custom Fields (ACF). Cheetah.org website managers can update and create content in a consistent way across the site, selecting from a toolkit of modular layout components like full-width banners, galleries, figures, and video.
