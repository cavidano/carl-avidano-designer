<IntroBlock>

Endangered Species Revenge (ESR) makes people laugh while raising awareness about endangered animals. 

</IntroBlock>

<TextBlock>

Through [Avidano Digital](/portfolio/avidano-digital), I designed and developed a new website which serves as a foundation for ESR to grow their video content and supporters. With a limited budget and timeline, a custom WordPress theme was made using Bootstrap.

The new ESR website balances humor with a sense of urgency. Visitors can watch funny videos, learn about conservation, and support endangered animals.
