<IntroBlock>

Endangered Species Revenge makes people laugh while raising awareness about endangered animals.

Through [Avidano Digital](/portfolio/avidano-digital), I designed and developed a new website which serves as a foundation for ESR to grow their video content and supporters. With a limited budget and timeline, a custom WordPress theme was made using Bootstrap 4. I continue to work with ESR, planning a blog and additional conservation projects for our next phase.

Donors can give to a specific project, or to the one that is most urgent, quickly and confidently from any device.

The new ESR website balances humor with a sense of urgency. Visitors can watch funny videos, learn about conservation, and support endangered animals.
