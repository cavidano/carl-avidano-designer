<IntroBlock>

Natura11y is an open source front-end toolkit. It helps designers and developers create rich, accessible experiences.

[Natura11y](https://gonatura11y.com) will be my first real contribution to the open source community. It's in pre-release. I aim to release version 1.0.0 in the first or second  quarter of 2022.

### What's with the name?

The name ***Natura11y*** is a combination of two words: *Natural* and *a11y*. The word accessibility is often refered to  ***a11y***, a numeronym referring to 'a' then 11 characters then 'y'.

Natura11y is a framework that:

- Feels natural to learn and use 
- Includes acessibility considerations
- Can adaptable and evolve for any type of project

I built the website for Natura11y using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a React-based open source framework. This approach allowed me to mix React components (for the examples) with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (for the documentation's text).

### The source code

The actual source code for Natura11y isn't too complex. My personal belief is that many front-end frameworks are over engineered. This creates a barrier to entry for folks that aren't as 'clever' as these framework's authors. More code means more technical debt. This can become an issue over time. Making it challenging to update and maintain. 

Natura11y uses Webpack and simple es6 modules. The styles (CSS) and functionality (JS) for
