<IntroBlock>

Natura11y is an open source front-end toolkit. It helps designers and developers create rich, accessible experiences.

</IntroBlock>

<TextBlock>

[Natura11y](https://gonatura11y.com) will be my first real contribution to the open source community. It's in pre-release. I aim to release version 1.0.0 in the first or second  quarter of 2022.

### What's with the name?

The name ***Natura11y*** is a combination of two words: *Natural* and *a11y*. Among web designers and developers, the word *accessibility* is often abbreviated to *a11y*. This numeronym refers to 'a' then '11' characters between 'y'.

Natura11y is a framework that:

- Feels natural to learn and use 
- Includes acessibility considerations
- Can adaptable and evolve for any type of project

### Creating the documentation

The documentation for Natura11y is a project in and of itself. I don't consider myself a natural writer. It took some time for me to get into the *flow* of writing. It helped me to remember that documentation is never final. It will change and evolve alongside the product it is written for.

<TextBlock>

I built the website for Natura11y using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a React-based open source framework. This approach allowed me to mix React components (for the examples) with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (for the documentation's text).

### Icon Library

I am also developing an icon library to be used with the framework.
