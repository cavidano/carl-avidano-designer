<IntroBlock>

Natura11y is an open source front-end toolkit. It helps designers and developers create rich, accessible experiences.

</IntroBlock>

<TextBlock>

[Natura11y](https://gonatura11y.com) will be my first real contribution to the open source community. It's in pre-release. I aim to release version 1.0.0 in the first or second  quarter of 2022.

### What's with the name?

The name ***Natura11y*** is a combination of two words: *Natural* and *a11y*. The word accessibility is often refered to  ***a11y***, a numeronym referring to 'a' then 11 characters then 'y'.

Natura11y is a framework that:

- Feels natural to learn and use 
- Includes acessibility considerations
- Can adaptable and evolve for any type of project

### Creating the documentation

The documentation for Natura11y is a project in and of itself. I don't consider myself a natural writer. It took some time for me to get into the *flow* of writing. It helped me to remember that documentation is never final. It will change and evolve alongside the product it is written for.

<TextBlock>

I built the website for Natura11y using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a React-based open source framework. This approach allowed me to mix React components (for the examples) with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) (for the documentation's text).

### The source code

The actual source code for Natura11y isn't too complex. Personally, I belief is that front-end frameworks are often over engineered. This creates a barrier to entry for folks that aren't as 'clever' as these framework authors. More code means more technical debt. This can become an issue over time. Making it challenging to update and maintain.
