Through [Avidano Digital](/portfolio/avidano-digital), I led the redesign of Brooklyn-based Mr. Ellie Pooh's e-commerce website.

### Modernizing with Shopify

We decided to use [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) for Mr. Ellie Pooh's website redesign. At the time, Shopify itself was new. Its liquid templating language has easy learning curve, which sped up development time. On top of that, Shopify has an efficient and modern inventory management system.

Their new online store balanced a delightful shopping experience with important insight into Mr. Ellie Pooh's mission: fair trade, sustainability, and conservation.
